<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently an associate professor in School of Information Science and Technology at Yunnan Normal University, start from spring 2024. Before that, I was an associate professor at School of Computer Science and Technology,  Xi’an University of Posts and Telecommunications. I received the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at Northwestern Polytechnical University in 2021, and received the B.E. degree in Electronic Information Engineering at Daqing Normal University in 2015.

I’m always looking for self-motivated master students and undergraduate intern. If you’re interested, please feel free to contact me by email.
